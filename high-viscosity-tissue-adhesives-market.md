<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Viscosity Tissue Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-OCA</li><li>n-2BCA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High viscosity tissue adhesives are medical products used to bond tissues during surgical procedures. Two common types are 2-Octyl Cyanoacrylate (2-OCA) and n-2-Butyl Cyanoacrylate (n-2BCA). 2-OCA is known for its flexibility and strength, making it suitable for a variety of applications. n-2BCA, on the other hand, has a longer setting time and is used in procedures where a longer bonding time is required. Both adhesives provide a strong and durable bond, helping to improve patient outcomes in surgical settings.</p></p>
