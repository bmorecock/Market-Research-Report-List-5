<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithium Carbonate Medical Tablets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sustained-release Tablets</li><li>Ordinary Tablets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Lithium Carbonate Medical Tablets market is categorized into two main types: sustained-release tablets and ordinary tablets. Sustained-release tablets are designed to release the active ingredient gradually over time, providing consistent therapeutic levels and minimizing potential side effects. In contrast, ordinary tablets release lithium carbonate quickly, leading to faster onset of action but potentially higher fluctuations in blood levels. Both forms serve to manage mood disorders effectively, catering to different patient needs and treatment regimens.</p></p>
