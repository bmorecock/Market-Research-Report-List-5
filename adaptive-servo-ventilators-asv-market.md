<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adaptive Servo Ventilators ASV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volume Triggered</li><li>Flow Triggered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adaptive Servo Ventilators (ASV) are advanced devices designed for patients with sleep apnea and respiratory disorders. The ASV market can be segmented into volume-triggered and flow-triggered types. Volume-triggered ASVs adjust ventilatory support based on delivered tidal volume, ensuring that patients receive adequate ventilation. In contrast, flow-triggered ASVs respond to the patient's breathing patterns, delivering support based on detected airflow, which provides a more responsive and comfortable experience. Both types aim to optimize respiratory function and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
