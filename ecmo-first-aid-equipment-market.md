<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ECMO First Aid Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ECMO First Aid Equipment market includes two main types: Veno-Arterial (VA) ECMO and Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO. VA ECMO is used for patients with severe cardiac and respiratory failure, providing circulatory support by oxygenating blood outside the body before returning it to the arterial system. In contrast, VV ECMO is primarily employed for patients with respiratory failure, allowing for oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal by diverting blood from a vein and returning it to the venous system. These two modalities cater to different clinical needs in critical care.</p></p>
