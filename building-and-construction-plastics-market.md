<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building and Construction Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Building and Construction Plastics market is primarily divided into two types: thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics. Thermoplastics, such as PVC and polyethylene, are characterized by their ability to be re-melted and molded multiple times, making them versatile for applications like pipes and insulation. In contrast, thermosetting plastics, like epoxy and polyester resins, undergo a chemical change during curing, resulting in materials that are rigid and heat-resistant, ideal for structural components and adhesives. Both types play essential roles in construction.</p></p>
