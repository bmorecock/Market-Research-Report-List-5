<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Profilometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Profilometer</li><li>Non-Contact Profilometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Profilometers are instruments used to measure surface profiles, roughness, and waviness. There are two main types of profilometers: Contact Profilometers, which use a stylus or probe to physically touch the surface being measured, and Non-Contact Profilometers, which use optical or laser technologies to measure surface characteristics without physically touching the surface. Contact Profilometers are generally more affordable and widely used, while Non-Contact Profilometers offer faster and non-destructive measurement capabilities but may come at a higher cost.</p></p>
