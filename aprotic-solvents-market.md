<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aprotic Solvents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dipolar Aprotic Solvent</li><li>Inert Solvent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aprotic solvents market comprises mainly two types: dipolar aprotic solvents and inert solvents. Dipolar aprotic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide and acetone, possess a significant dipole moment, enhancing their ability to dissolve polar solutes and facilitating various chemical reactions. In contrast, inert solvents, like hexane and toluene, are non-polar and typically used in applications where chemical reactivity is not desired, offering stability and compatibility in processes such as extraction and chromatography. Both types play crucial roles in chemical industries.</p></p>
