<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Linear Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting</li><li>Double-Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydraulic linear actuators are devices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical motion. The two main types are single-acting and double-acting actuators. Single-acting actuators use hydraulic pressure to extend the actuator, while a return spring is used to retract it. On the other hand, double-acting actuators use hydraulic pressure to extend and retract the actuator, providing more precise control over the motion. Both types are commonly used in a variety of industrial applications for tasks such as lifting, lowering, and positioning.</p></p>
