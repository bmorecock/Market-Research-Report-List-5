<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Night Vision Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorption Filtration</li><li>Laminated Filtration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Night vision filters enhance visibility in low-light conditions through two primary types: absorption filtration and laminated filtration. Absorption filtration utilizes materials that selectively absorb specific wavelengths of light, allowing only desired wavelengths to pass through, thus improving clarity and contrast. In contrast, laminated filtration involves layering different optical materials, which can enhance durability and reduce glare while providing enhanced visual performance. Both types cater to specialized applications in military, security, and recreational areas, ensuring optimal night vision capabilities.</p></p>
