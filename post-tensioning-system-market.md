<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Post-Tensioning System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unbonded Post-Tensioning System</li><li>Bonded Post-Tensioning System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The post-tensioning system market is primarily divided into two types: unbonded and bonded post-tensioning systems. Unbonded post-tensioning involves using steel tendons that are not permanently bonded to the surrounding concrete, allowing for movement and flexibility, making it suitable for structures experiencing temperature variations. In contrast, bonded post-tensioning systems have tendons grouted in ducts, providing enhanced protection against corrosion and ensuring a durable connection between the tendon and concrete, ideal for high-load applications. Both systems are crucial for enhancing structural performance and durability.</p></p>
